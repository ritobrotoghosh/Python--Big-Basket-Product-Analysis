# Python--Big-Basket-Product-Analysis

I created this notebook to conduct a thorough analysis of the products available on Big Basket. The goal was to compare their prices with those found in the open market and gain a comprehensive understanding of their business model.

## Dataset

This dataset contains 10 attributes which are described as follows:

- **index** - Simply the Index!
- **product** - Title of the product (as they're listed)
- **category** - Category into which product has been classified
- **sub_category** - Subcategory into which product has been kept
- **brand** - Manufacturing brand of the product
- **sale_price** - Price at which product is being sold on the site
- **market_price** - Market price of the product
- **type** - Type into which product falls
- **rating** - The rating received from consumers
- **description** - Detailed description of the product

## Conclusion

Here are the findings from my analysis:

**1)** Many of the products they sell are offered at a discounted price compared to the market rate.
**2)** However, we had no scope to include the consideration of delivery charges.

So, in my opinion, if you're placing bulk orders, Big Basket can offer significant savings. However, if you're ordering individual items, the discounted product prices may be offset by the delivery charges. This means that the total cost could end up being similar to or even higher than the market price.
